We created an educational game to teach children the importance of maintaining good hygiene, especially now with the COVID-19 pandemic. The point of the game is to control the user icon and avoid the virus. There will also be power-ups‚ú® in the form of masks and hand sanitizers that provide "immunity" for 10 and 5 seconds respectively. If the user can last the entire duration without losing all of their lives (‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è) , then they win. Of course our game also has fun facts and reminders that pop up on the side as the user is playing the game. 

We created this entirely with the p5.js library. Enjoy!
